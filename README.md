# How to manually validate a JWT access token using Microsoft identity platform (formerly Azure Active Directory for developers)

**There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0)

Check it out: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/2-WebApp-graph-user/2-3-Multi-Tenant

If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapi-manual-jwt-validation/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
